## Personal Blog with Ghost CMS

## Objective

The objective of this project was to deploy a self-hosted blogging platform using Ghost CMS within a Docker container, focusing on simplicity, persistence, and real-world container orchestration. This project demonstrates how to launch a containerized content management system with permanent data storage using Docker volumes, and how to manage application lifecycle using Docker Compose. The setup mimics a production environment where CMS platforms are containerized for scalability and portability.

### Skills Learned

- Writing Docker Compose files for single-service applications
- Volume mapping for persistent content storage
- Exposing web application ports to the host
- Using Ghost environment variables to congiure a CMS
- Docker container lifecycle management (start, stop, rebuild)
- Testing persistence & backup through Docker volumes

### Tools Used

- Docker Desktop (Windows):
Used to run and manage containerized via GUI & CLI
- Docker Compose:
Automates container configuration, deployment, & orchestration
- Ghost (Docker Image):
Open-source headless Node.js-based blogging platform
- PowerShell:
Used to interact with Docker CLI from the host system
- Windows 11 Host:
Local system running Docker & storing volume-mapped blog content

## Steps
üèóÔ∏è Ref 1: Compose File Setup

A docker-compose.yml file was created to define both the MySQL and Adminer services in a single configuration.

‚öôÔ∏è Ref 2: Running the Containers

The following command was executed from the project root to launch both containers:

üü¢ Result:
- MySQL service starts at internal port 3306
- Adminer UI available at http://localhost:8080

üåê Ref 3: Accessing Adminer

With Adminer running, it was accessed via browser:

üìç http://localhost:8080

Login Configuration:
- System: MySQL
- Server: db (Docker service name, resolved internally)
- Username: user123
- Password: pass123
- Database: sampledb

üìä Ref 4: Result Verification

‚úÖ Successful verification included:
- Adminer connected to the MySQL container via service name db

- Test tables and entries were created through Adminer UI

- Data persisted across docker-compose down and up (volume verification)

- Adminer allowed full CRUD operations on the sampledb

‚úÖ Outcome
- Deployed and configured a basic database stack using Docker Compose.
- Demonstrated inter-container networking, volume persistence, and service orchestration.
- Set the stage for future back-end or data-driven projects that rely on relational databases.
- Built a foundation for integrating MySQL with other containerized services (Node.js, PHP, etc.).
