## CI/CD Pipeline in Docker

## Objective

The objective of this project was to deploy a lightweight, fully containerized CI/CD system using Jenkins on Docker Compose. This enhanced setup introduces HTTPS with a self-signed certificate using an NGINX reverse proxy, externalized environment variables via a .env file, and pipeline-as-code through a Jenkinsfile sourced from SCM. These upgrades replicate modern production CI/CD pipelines and promote security, modularity, and maintainability on a local Windows environment.

### Skills Learned

- Writing modular docker-compose.yml files to run multi-container CI systems
- Configuring Docker-in-Docker (DinD) for building Docker images within pipelines
- Using NGINX as a reverse proxy to enable HTTPS for Jenkins UI
- Mounting Docker socket for Jenkins container access to the host Docker daemon
- Creating Groovy-based pipeline-as-code using Jenkinsfile
- Securing Jenkins with TLS, CLI secrets, and controlled admin initialization
- Persisting Jenkins data using Docker named volumes
- Integrating SCM-based pipelines for GitOps-style automation

### Tools Used

- Docker Desktop (Windows):
  Run and manage containerized services with CLI & GUI
- Docker Compose:
  Defined multi-container environments for Jenkins, DinD, & NGINX
- Jenkins (Docker image):
  Core CI/CD server
- docker:dind (Docker-in-Docker):
  Allows Jenkins to build Docker images from within containers
- NGINX:
  Revese proxy to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS)
- OpenSSL:
  For generating self-signed certificates
- PowerShell:
  Used to execute Docker CLI commands
- Windows 11 Host:
  Host system for executing the entire CI/CD stack locally

## Steps

## 🧱 Ref 1: Compose File Setup

A docker-compose.yml file was created to define the Jenkins and DinD services, with volume persistence and Docker socket mounting for container operations.

    services:
      dind:
        image: docker:dind
        container_name: dind
        privileged: true
        networks:
          - jenkins
  
    jenkins:
      image: jenkins/jenkins:lts
      container_name: jenkins
      user: root
      ports:
        - "8080:8080"
        - "50000:50000"
      volumes:
        - jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home
        - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      networks:
        - jenkins
      depends_on:
        - dind

    volumes:
      jenkins_home:
    
    networks:
      jenkins:

📁 The jenkins_home volume was used to persist Jenkins jobs, plugins, and settings across container restarts.

## ⚙️ Ref 2: Running the Container

The project was launched using:

    docker-compose up -d

✅ Services started successfully:
- Jenkins accessible at: http://localhost:8080
- Docker-in-Docker running for container builds

## 🌐 Ref 3: Accessing Jenkins

Web interface accessed via:
📍 http://localhost:8080

🔐 Jenkins default setup:

    docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

🛡️ Password was changed after login and Suggested Plugins were installed.

## 🔁 Ref 4: Creating Pipeline & Build Job

A Pipeline job was created with the following Jenkinsfile:

    pipeline {
      agent any
  
      stages {
          stage('Build') {
              steps {
                  sh 'echo Building Docker container...'
                  sh 'docker --version'
              }
          }
          stage('Test') {
              steps {
                  sh 'echo Running tests...'
              }
          }
          stage('Deploy') {
              steps {
                  sh 'echo Deploying application...'
              }
          }
      }
    }

⚙️ CLI tools were installed inside the Jenkins container:

    docker exec -u root -it jenkins bash
    apt update
    apt install -y docker.io
    exit

## 🔐 Ref 5: Jenkins Authentication & Secrets
- Default admin password retrieved securely
- Manual password change enforced after first login
- No exposed credentials in compose or Dockerfiles

## 📦 Ref 6: Persistent Volumes & Restarts
- jenkins_home volume ensured data persisted even after restarts:
-     docker-compose down
      docker-compose up -d

- No loss of jobs, plugins, or configuration across sessions.

## 🧪 Ref 7: CI/CD Pipeline Execution Output

✅ Sample pipeline output:

-  Build: Validated Docker CLI
-  Test: Simulated unit tests
-  Deploy: Dummy deploy command
-  Verified through Jenkins Blue Ocean UI and console logs
